    After a long day you''ve become very tired.

    As you try to move a
    muscle you notice have become frozen in place.

    A gust of wind appears, but
    you don''t feel it on your skin.

    You feel it from within your mind.

    Suddenly,
    you feel as if you''re being pulled back. Back to the start...

    ...'
  - 'Tired?

    Learn to play plz.'

    After that final blow you feel the very essence of your life leaving
    your body.

    You find yourself in a dark tunnel with a bright light at the
    end.

    You start to drift towards the light.

    As you get closer and closer
    to the light, it all starts to feel familiar to you.

    Surely you''ve been
    here before...

    ...'
  - 'You died lol.


    Get rekt!'
